# CafeApp

On this semester we will develop an app. 

Currently we are in App-Idea-Mode and on this Github there are two ideas competing.

## Ordering App

This app is for ordering food/drink items in the cafe.

## Booking App

This app is for making and managing bookings at the cafe.

## In general

Both apps has a separate customer and a employee view.
Both apps are connected to remote servers and databases

Currently the descriptions of the apps are in danish, but they will get translated soon.
